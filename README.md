# tinder-liker

A simple Bash script that likes all Tinder profiles using ADB (https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).

Syntax: ./tinder-liker.sh [x coordinate] [y coordinate] [delay]

Where x and y coordinates are the coordinates of the like (heart button) and delay is the interval in seconds between presses.

You can figure out your phone's like button coordinates by enabling "Pointer location" under "Developer options".

Enjoy!
